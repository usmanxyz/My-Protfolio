    <h1>My Hobbies </h1>
    <hr>
    <h>My favorite hobbies are coding and reading, and I enjoy them whenever I have free time. Coding allows me to create new
    things, solve problems, and improve my logical thinking. It is exciting to write programs and see them work
    successfully. I love learning new programming languages and exploring different ways to make software more efficient. On
    the other hand, reading helps me expand my knowledge and imagination. Whether itâ€™s books, articles, or online resources,
    reading allows me to explore new ideas and gain valuable insights. Both hobbies help me stay productive, improve my
    focus, and enhance my creativity. Coding challenges my mind, while reading relaxes me and provides a break from screens.
    Together, these hobbies shape my personality and contribute to my learning journey. I cannot imagine my life without
    them!</h1>
